# eb-tokens-api

> A REST API for generating and validating Echobind Tokens.

## What are EB Tokens?

EB Tokens are tokens that are 10 digits long, start with a 9, and are validated by the [Luhn Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm).

## Configuration

The service is configured using environemnt variables. These variables are loaded from a `.env` file. By default the `.env` file in the root project folder will be used. However, you can specify a file by passing it using the `--envFile` argument when starting the service (e.g. `npm run server:start -- --envFile=secrets/env.test`).

A sample env file is provided: `./.env.dist`.

The following environment variables should be provided:

- `PORT` â€” The port to listen on.
- `LOG_ENABLED` - If set to a truthy value, logs will be enabled.
- `CORS_ORIGINS` - A comma-separated list of origins that may be included in the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` response header. Basically if a request is made from an origin included in this list, it will be sent back in the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` response header. If `*` is provided, then `*` will be the value of the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` response header.
- `CORS_METHOS` - The list of methods to included in the `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` response header. If `*` is provided, then `*` will be the value of the `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` response header.

## Setup

```
git clone https://github.com/cullylarson/eb-tokens-api.git
npm install
cp .env.dist .env
vim .env
# set environment variables
```

## Production

Build the project (see the Setup section) and deploy using the environment of your choice. To start the server, run `npm run server:start`.


## Development

When setting up the service for development, you must use `secrets/env.dev` as the name of your env file (see the Configuration section).

1. Start the server using `npm run server:start:dev`. This will start the serer and reload on changes to files in the `./server` folder.

2. Run `npm run lint` to lint the project.

3. Run `npm run test` to test.
